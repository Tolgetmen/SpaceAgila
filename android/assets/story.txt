In a third world country like Philippines, space exploration is a very hard journey to take. But amidst all the obstacles and shortcomings the Filipino engineers took, they managed to build a spaceship with a resemblance to their national flag. But due to lack of resources, they only built it with limited features such that the spaceship doesn't have the capacity to carry guns and bullets.

Now they are ready to take a new step into space and explore the wonders beyond the planet and solar system!

And you are the pilot of that spaceship! Help them navigate through all those debris and obstacles hindering the space exploration.

So buckle up and get ready to the journey beyond! 
May the force be with you.
