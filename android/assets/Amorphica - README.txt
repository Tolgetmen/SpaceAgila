Amorphica

Terms Of Use:

1. Don't upload it elsewhere claiming it is yours. Should you want to place it in a collection outside DA, authorization is required and can be obtained at my user page, either at http://matiasromero.deviantart.com/ or http://www.fontspace.com/matias-romero
or sending me a request to matiasromero at gmail.com. Permission is most likely to be given, but it has to be asked for. Needless to say, a link back to http://matiasromero.deviantart.com/ is required even with such authorization.
2. No racist, homophobic, hatred, etc. works with this font.
3. Credit and link to my user page, so that others may find this resource and the link to its source too, if there's one.
4. Send me a link, I always love to see what's being done with these fonts.
5. Commercial use is subjected to donation.
